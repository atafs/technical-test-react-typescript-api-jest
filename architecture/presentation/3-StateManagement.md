# Neurolabs State Management Summary

This document summarizes the state management approach used in the Neurolabs project, focusing on the use of React hooks and the inclusion of React Context. It also discusses the potential for integrating Redux in the future.

## React Hooks

- **Usage**: React hooks, such as `useState` and `useEffect`, are employed to manage local state and side effects within individual components.
- **Functionality**: These hooks store state in memory at the component level, ensuring that each component's state is isolated and only accessible within that component or through explicit prop passing.
- **Examples**:
  - In `ImageUploader.tsx`, `useState` manages the selected file and preview URL.
  - In `CatalogView.tsx`, `useState` handles the list of catalog items, loading state, and error messages.
  - `IRTaskView.tsx` uses `useState` for tasks, selected task, submission details, loading, and error states.
  - `TaskStatusDisplay.tsx` utilizes `useState` for status, error, loading, and retry count.

## React Context

- **Inclusion**: The project includes a React Context (`AppContext`) to demonstrate its capabilities for sharing state across the component tree.
- **Current Usage**: Although set up to provide the API key, the context is not actively used because the API key is hardcoded in the code.
- **Purpose**: Including context showcases an understanding of advanced state management techniques in React, which can be leveraged for sharing global state without prop drilling.

## Future Considerations: Redux

- **Potential Integration**: As the application grows, integrating Redux could provide a more comprehensive state management solution.
- **Benefits**: Redux offers a centralized store for the entire application, making it easier to manage complex state interactions and ensuring predictable state mutations.
- **Scalability**: This would enhance the maintainability and scalability of the project, aligning with best practices for larger React applications.
